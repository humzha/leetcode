## Problem Summary

Given an `m x n` matrix, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0`.  
The modification must be done **in-place**.

---

## Approach

1. **Mark zeros:**  
   Iterate over every element of the matrix.  
   - If an element is `0`, mark its row and column to be zeroed.  
   - Use `matrix[0][0]` to track whether the **first row** and **first column** should be zeroed (avoiding extra arrays).

2. **Zero inner rows and columns:**  
   Zero out all rows and columns from index `1` to `m-1` / `n-1` based on the marks.

3. **Zero first row and column:**  
   If the first row or first column contains a zero, zero them out.

## Complexity

| Metric | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| Time   | O(n Ã— m)   |
| Space  | O(1) |

---

## Notes

- This in-place approach is preferable to using additional row/column arrays (which would require O(n + m) space).  
- Ensure careful handling of the first row and first column since they are used as markers.
