## Problem Summary

Given an integer `numRows`, return the first `numRows` of Pascal's Triangle.  
In Pascal's Triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

---

## Approach

0. **Create the 2D Array**
    - First level is 1-size, last level is n-size
    - [1..n]
1. **Populate [1..n] in that order**
    - Given i - 1th row, we can determine the ith row in a Pascal Triangle

```python
# Calculate Row
0 -> [1]
_ -> calc_next_row(i - 1)

# Calculating the elements of a row
f(i, j) = res[i - 1][j - 1] + res[i - 1][j]
```
> Calculating the elements of the row requires to know the elements of the previous row: write a check to not go OOB.
> Go from top to bot [0..n-1] in creating Pascal's Triangle.
